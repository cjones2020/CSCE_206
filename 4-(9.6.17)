*[Lab notes]
* linux.cs.tamu.edu is automatically linux 2. Has own folder.
* "ls", "ls -al", and "pwd" commands that allow you to NOT map network drive

*[S5]
* {: begins the body of the function. }: ends the function. Also group statements.
* printf(): function that prints to screen.
* "Hello, world\n": string constant. \n indicates a newline
*[WS]
* 'A' = charcter
* "A" = string

*[S6]
* All decleartions and statements in C end with a ;
* return 0: 0 is returbed to the main(). Tells the OS it was successful
*[WS]
* Natural (N): 0, 1, 2, ...
* Integers (Z): ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
* Rational (Q): m/n (m, n = Z ; n ≠ 0)
* Real (R): π, √2
* Complex (C): a + bi (a, b, = R)
* Hypercomplex: ai + bj + ck + d
* Because there are only 32 bits, we cannot store anything beyond rational numbers

*[S7]
# include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, \n")
    printf("world!\n")
    return 0;
}
* Looks different but the same!

*[S8]
# include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world\n")
    printf("Hello, universe!\n")
    retunr 0;
}
* printf("Hello, world\nHello, universe\n") also works instead of printf("...\n") printf("...\n")

*[S9]
* Variables store values
* Different types of variables by but must be specified (intger, float, string, etc.)

*[S10]
* Algorithm for Hesperus
*   Assign # of fathoms to variable
*   Convert fathoms to feet and store in variable
*   Convert feet to inches and store in variable
*   Print different units of measure neatly to screen

*[S11]
include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int inches, feet, fathoms
    
    fathoms = 7;
    feet = 6 * fathoms;
    inches = 12 * feet;
    printf("%d fathoms\n", fathoms);
    printf("%d feet\n", feet);
    printf("%d inches\n", inches);
    return 0
}
* "int inches, feet, fathoms" can be seperated for each one. Used with different variable types or if variable name is too long.
